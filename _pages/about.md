I am a policy researcher focusing on computational social science, policy process research, and reproductive rights/women's health policy. I am pursuing a Master of Public Policy at [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) and hold a B.A. in Political Science from [FernUniversität in Hagen](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/KSW/portale/bapvs/) and a Mag. phil. in Art History from the [University of Vienna](https://kunstgeschichte.univie.ac.at/en/).

With experience in academia and the professional world, I have worked as a research assistant at [WZB Berlin](https://wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/transformations-of-democracy) and the [CoronaNet Research Project](https://www.coronanet-project.org/). My research has been published in reputable journals, and I have presented my work at various conferences. I am an active member of the International Public Policy Association and the European Consortium for Political Research, as well as a volunteer for CorrelAid e.V. and Doctors for Choice e.V.

My background includes program development at the United Nations with Friendship Ambassadors Foundation, and experience in the art and publishing industries. I am fluent in German and English, with proficiency in several other languages, and possess technical skills including R programming, Git & GitHub, Python, MS Office, Adobe Creative Suite, and social media management.

As a dedicated researcher and professional, I am committed to using my expertise to inform and shape public policy, promote social justice, and advance the understanding of key issues. Connect with me to discuss research, policy, or collaboration opportunities.
