I am a policy researcher focusing on computational social science, policy process research, and reproductive rights. I am pursuing a Master of Public Policy at [Hertie School](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) and hold a B.A. in Political Science from [FernUniversität in Hagen](https://www.fernuni-hagen.de/KSW/portale/bapvs/) and a Mag. phil. in Art History from the [University of Vienna](https://kunstgeschichte.univie.ac.at/en/).

With experience in academia and the professional world, I currently work as a research assistant in the [Transformations of Democracy Unit](https://wzb.eu/en/research/dynamics-of-political-systems/transformations-of-democracy) at WZB Berlin Social Science Center, directed by Daniel Ziblatt and have previously worked at the [CoronaNet Research Project](https://www.coronanet-project.org/). My research has been published in peer-reviewed journals, and I have presented my work at various conferences. 

My background includes conference program development at the United Nations with Friendship Ambassadors Foundation, and experience in the art and publishing industries. I am fluent in German and English, with proficiency in several other languages, and possess technical skills including R programming, Git & GitHub, MS Office, Adobe Creative Suite, and social media management.

As a dedicated researcher and professional, I am committed to using my expertise to inform and shape public policy, promote social justice, and advance the understanding of key issues. Connect with me to discuss research, policy, or collaboration opportunities.
